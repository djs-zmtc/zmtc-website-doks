## Introduction

It is ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to [https://zmtcreative.net][website] (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://zmtcreative.net"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.

## Personal Information and Analytics

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC's visitors use its website. From time to time, ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC does not provide user accounts for non-employees and therefore does **not** collect potentially personally-identifying information. ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC also does **not** provide commenting functionality and therefore does **not** track any potentially personally-identifying related to comments on [https://zmtcreative.net][website] blog posts.

### Security

The security of any Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any information we collect, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Advertisements

Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

As noted, ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC does **not** provide non-employee accounts and offers no method for commenting, nor do we intentionally collect any personally-identifying information. However, in the event we do collect potentially personally-identifying information, such disclosures of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information would be only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC's behalf or to provide services available at ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC, third parties or the public at large.

If ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC offers email mailing list subscriptions (e.g. via Constant Contact(tm), Mailchimp(tm), etc.), ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. Please see the appropriate Privacy and Terms documents for these external mailing list sites for information about their policies.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ZMT&nbsp;Creative&nbsp;LLC takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
